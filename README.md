I am currently a student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), studying in Level 2, Term 2. As a passionate full-stack developer, I have a strong foundation in designing, developing, and deploying dynamic web applications. My expertise includes both frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to create seamless and efficient user experiences.

In addition to my web development skills, I am actively exploring the exciting field of Machine Learning (ML). I am eager to delve deeper into this domain, gaining proficiency in algorithms, data analysis, and model building to solve real-world problems.

I strive to bridge the gap between software development and data-driven solutions, aiming to leverage my skills to innovate and contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.
